This is an example of the power of HTML, CSS and JS. I'm a new web designer and developper. You can find a lot of different proyects on HitHub, this is only my repository to test my excersices. I did the parallax.js just with my previous programing knowledge and taking some references from w3schools.

You can see my example here: https://wilsoft-gt.github.io/wilpax/
